# Terminology Service Widgets Demonstration (React)
A simple Next.js project to demonstrate the integration of the React Terminology Service Suite widgets.

For this demo, a Next.js app was set up with `Node.js v18.18.0`.

## Install and run the demo application

1) Authenticate
Copy your GitHub PAT into the `.npmrc` file. 
Click [here](https://ts4nfdi.github.io/terminology-service-suite/comp/latest/) for detailed instructions of the authentication process.

2) Install
The widgets are developed with React 17. 
If the consumer app uses React > 17, the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag must be set during installation. 
We are in the process of testing the widgets with React versions > 17, but there may still be unwanted behavior.
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

3) Run
```bash
npm run dev
```
to start the app in development mode.

## Implementation

package.

A sample integration is shown in `MainPage.tsx`.


## React Next.js Widgets Demo Project - Docker Usage

This guide explains how to use the provided `Dockerfile` to build and run the Next.js application in a Docker container.

### Building the Docker Image
To build the Docker image, run the following command in the project root directory:

```sh
docker build -t react-next-widgets-demo .
```

This command will create a Docker image named `react-next-widgets-demo`.

### Running the Container
Once the image is built, you can run a container with:

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 react-next-widgets-demo
```

This maps port 3000 inside the container to port 3000 on your local machine.

### Accessing the Application
After running the container, open a web browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Stopping the Container
To stop the running container, press `Ctrl+C` if running in the foreground, or find the container ID with:

```sh
docker ps
```

Then stop it using:

```sh
docker stop <container_id>
```

### Running in Detached Mode
To run the container in the background (detached mode), use:

```sh
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 react-next-widgets-demo
```

To view logs from a detached container:

```sh
docker logs <container_id>
```

### Cleaning Up
To remove the container:

```sh
docker rm <container_id>
```

To remove the image:

```sh
docker rmi react-next-widgets-demo
```

### Development Mode
If you want to mount your local project folder inside the container for development, use:

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app react-next-widgets-demo
```

This ensures changes in your local project reflect inside the container.
